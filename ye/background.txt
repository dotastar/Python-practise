1.Mutable VS Immutable

Immutability means that objects of a certain type can not change in any meaningful way to outside observers
Integer, String, etc are immutable
Generally all value types should be
Array objects are mutable
It may be an array of references to immutable types, but the array itself is mutable
Meaning you can set those references to anything you want
Also true for array of primitives
An immutable array will not be practical
References to objects can be shared
If the object is mutable, mutation will be seen through all these references
